Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark
# Task 5 – Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark

## 📌 Objective
To capture and analyze network traffic and identify basic protocols.

## 📂 Method
- Since I am using a mobile device, I used a sample `.pcap` file from the Wireshark Sample Captures website.
- I uploaded the file to an online analyzer (apacket.com)to view and filter the packets.
- Observed different types of network protocols.

## 🔍 Protocols Identified
1. **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
   - Used to resolve domain names (e.g., converting google.com into IP address).  

2. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**  
   - Used for web browsing (loading web pages).  

3. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
   - Ensures reliable data transfer using handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).  

## ✅ Findings
- Captured packets showed communication between client and server.  
- DNS queries resolved domain names.  
- HTTP requests fetched web page content.  
- TCP managed connection reliability.  

## 📝 Conclusion
Packet analysis helps in understanding communication, troubleshooting network problems, and detecting suspicious traffic.
